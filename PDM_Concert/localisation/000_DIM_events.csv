DIM_BEL_nederlands_belgisch_taalcongress_title;A Belgian-Dutch Language and Literature Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_BEL_nederlands_belgisch_taalcongress_desc;While a large part of our population speaks Dutch, it has never been a very important language. At court, in government and among the bourgeoisie French is 'la langue preferee,' and Dutch is looked down onto with some disdain. This has left precious little room in our country for the development of the language. The situation is different of course by our neighbour to the north. The Dutch have proven more supportive of the Flemish, and both Dutch and Flemish scholars have now come together in Gent to discuss the language. The hope is to form a more unified and standardised language, and in imitation of German and French efforts, create an extensive dictionary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_nederlands_belgisch_taalcongress_title;The Nederlansch Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_nederlands_belgisch_taalcongress_desc;One of the causes of the Belgian Revolution was our language policy. The majority of the elites, being Francophone, disdained Dutch and our efforts to make it the national language. It should thus come as no surprise that, after independence, French was swiftly elected as the official language. This has caused some resentment among the Flemish, who find it gives precious little room for their own cultural expression.\nIn an effort to strengthen the cultural base of Dutch in Belgium, Flemish language scholars have joined up with Dutch language scholars in Ghent for an international language and literature congress. The development and unification of the Dutch language is one of the main goals of the congress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_the_first_dictionary_title;The First Dictionary?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_the_first_dictionary_desc;For much of history, there has not been a unified Dutch language. Numerous regional varieties exists, with Hollandic Dutch being the most prominent. A movement towards a unified language does exist, but it hampered by a lack of an unambiguous structure of the language. Official rules regarding the language do exist, but they too show regional differences. Language scholars have now recommended to create one national dictionary, and get rid of the regional differences in spelling and pronunciation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_woordenboek_der_nederlandsche_taal_title;The Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_woordenboek_der_nederlandsche_taal_desc;After many years of work, the first true dictionary of the Dutch language has been produced: The Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal. While there may have been earlier dictionaries, perhaps most famously by 16th century scholar Kiliaan, none of these were of the calibre of this new dictionary. They were mainly translation dictionaries, or used regional spelling differences. The 'Nieuw Woordenboek der Nederandsche Taal' uses the new (official and unified) spelling rules.\n\nThe dictionary as released is only the first of a large series. The aim of the dictionary is to describe every word in use in the Dutch language since 1500. Such a massive task will take many more years to complete.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The definitions given in the original dictionary were found to be to vague and imprecise by van Dale. As a teacher he aimed his dictionary at students, and desired a clear cut and precise definition of words.\n\nThe dictionary is often referred to as 'De Dikke van Dale' [The Thick one by van Dale], because, at 1400 pages, it is the thickest book in the common household, after the bible of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_dagbladzegel_title;The Dagbladzegel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_dagbladzegel_desc;Some say the Dagbladzegel (the newspaper tax) has had its day, and voices are being raised to abolish it. The tax was originally introduced by emperor Napoleon, and has proven a useful tool to control public opinion. The steepness of the tax (up to half of the price of the newspaper) has made sure only the elites get to read the papers, and no new [radical] papers will founded. An excellent tool to control public opinion thus, but one which belongs in a museum say some.\n\nA bill has been brought to parliament to abolish the tax.

DIM_USA_friendship_incident_desc;Building upon good relations with the Sultanate of Atjeh, and cutting out the expensive Dutch middleman, traders from Salem (MA) have become a world player on the pepper market. Unfortunately trading in the Indies is always a hazardous enterprise, as piracy is rife in the area. While previously the good trading relations deterred most piracy, in recent years competition and oversupply have caused price to drop and relations to become strained.\n\nWhile loading pepper on the west coast of Sumatra, the ship the Friendship of Salem was taken by pirates. The trader himself only barely managed to escape into the jungle, but his crew was not so lucky. Before the trader managed to return with reinforcements and retake his ship, 5 men lay death, 6 were injured and 3 suffered life long disabilities.\nOur national honour requires as response!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_friendship_incident_desc;Like other places in the world lacking a strong central government, the waters around Atjeh are rife with pirates and brigands. However as the pepper from Atjeh is of particularly high quality, many traders are willing to run the risk of pirates.\n\nA Yankee trader, the Freedom of Salem, has gotten himself in a little bit of a whiff when his ship was attacked by local pirates while loading his cargo. The trader himself managed to escape and flee into the jungle, but all of his crew was so lucky though. Before the trader managed to return with reinforcements and retake his ship, 5 men lay death, 6 were injured and 3 suffered life long disabilities.\n The Americans have not taken kindly to this incident, and are preparing action.

overland_route_desc;The communications with our colonies in Asia has to take the long way round the Cape. This has not always been the case. Before he Napoleonic Wars there existed an 'overland route' through Egypt: Ships would dock at Alexandria and then transfer passengers via the Nile to Cairo, from where they would take an coach to the Red Sea. Ottoman opposition and the war put an end to the route however. Reopening of the route proved difficult due to the coast of supplying coal to Egypt, until recently that is. A young entrepreneur has proven coal can be supplied at a fraction of the costs. This has led to the reopening of the overland route, cutting journey times from 90 days to 35.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

She now unequivocally satisfies the wealth criterion, and has asked the city of Amsterdam to add her name to the voting register. Which the city of Amsterdam naturally declined, the spirit of the law is clear: it was ever only intended to grant men the right to vote.

DIM_NET_uitbreiding_amsterdam_title;Expansion of Amsterdam;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_uitbreiding_amsterdam_desc;The old city of Amsterdam has reached the limits of number of people it can house. The green courtyards behind the mansions and even the alleyways between them are filling up with slums. The squalor of these slums is so great that inhabitants really see the sun, or smell the fresh air. It is unsurprising that the city is prone to outbreaks of disease such as tuberculosis or cholera.\nDue to these circumstances, as well as the expected further growth of the city, a new plan has been presented for the expansion of the city. It promises large sweeping green-spaces, wide avenues and room for spacious mansions. It is hailed as a plan worthy for our capital. Unfortunately, it is also a very expensive plan. A more modest plan has also been presented. It still provides vastly superior housing compared to the slums, but sacrifices the large green spaces and avenues for more houses and cheaper execution. Which plan shall be implemented?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

They are furthermore abhorred by our use of violence against the inlanders to maintain and extend our rule.

DIM_PAP_herstel_bisschoppen_desc;Calvinism is the dominant faith in the Netherlands, and while perhaps Catholics have not faced the same level of prosecution as seen elsewhere (or indeed, Protestants have faced from Catholics elsewhere), they are discriminated against. The new Dutch constitution, however, attempts to right this wrong, and protects all religions, Catholics included, from discrimination. Under the constitution we can restore our bishops to the country, and restore the Catholic faith to its rightful place!\n[Controlling Rome, either directly or indirectly, gives you access to this decision.];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_herstel_bisschoppen_title;Ex Qua Die Arcano;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_herstel_bisschoppen_desc;The constitution of 1815 provided, in theory, for freedom of religion, but in practice Calvinism maintained the dominant faith. To keep Catholics subdued and away from power, barriers remained in place right up until our new constitution with its famous anti-discrimination clause.\nTaking advantage of the new constitution, the Pope has issued a Papal Bull, the 'Ex Qua Die Arcano,' to right the 'great injustices and evils' Catholics had suffered under the 'frenzy of the Calvinstic heresy' in our country. With this Bull the Pope ends the status of our country as target for missionaries, and restores the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy in our country. Five new Bishoprics have been created: Utrecht, Haarlem, 's Hertogenbosch, Breda and Roermond. In honour of saint Willibrord, apostle of the Low Countries, the Pope has selected Utrecht as the site of the archbishopric of the Netherlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_aprilbeweging_title;The April Movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_aprilbeweging_desc;A public storm of protest has gripped our country after the Pope restored the bishops here. In his Bull, the pope had made many tactless moves, such as claim to protect the Catholics from 'the frenzy of the Calvinistic heresy,' or naming Utrecht, bastion of the Reformation, the archbishopric. Protestants have not taken kindly to this, some even claiming the bull makes the 'king a slave of the Pope, even more than king Philip of Spain, murderer of William the Silent, would have wanted to be.'\n\nA motion sponsored by the conservatives (and supported by over 200.000 signatures from the public) has now passed parliament asking the king to condemn this act of the Pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_a_visit_to_Utrecht_title;A Visit to Utrecht;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_a_visit_to_Utrecht_desc;The king's recent visit to Utrecht has been quite a sight! The local newspapers had called upon the populace to reject the liberal constitution and come out to hail the king. Fireworks was sent up into the sky, the streets were decorated triumphal arches, the Prinsenvlag (orange-white-blue, for one nation under God and the King) flying from the homes, while children sang praise to the king. The whole city turned out to great the king. All except the Catholics, they wisely choose to remain at home. Rumours about in the city and country about a possible coup d'etat, and the king's entry into the city as a triumphant general certainly did not quell these.\n\nThe choice of Utrecht as archbishopric is particularly painful for the Protestants: it is where the Union of Utrecht was signed in 1579, liberating the country from the Catholic domination of the Spanish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_the_end_of_thorbecke_title;An Indiscreet King;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_the_end_of_thorbecke_desc;According to journalists, the king has made some 'undiplomatic' statements in relation to the anti-Catholic sentiment sweeping the nation. He is reported to be of the opinion that this sentiment has caused: 'the bond between the House of Orange and the Fatherland to be closer and dearer to his heart.' He is also reported to have said that there have been 'many tense moments' between himself and the government.\n\n This is a clear violation of the trust between king and government. To preserve the illusion of concord between king and government (and thus make government possible), this can only end in one of two ways: the king retracts, or the government falls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_cultuurstelsel_desc;The wars with Belgium, on Java and on Sumatra have drained the treasury, and we are quickly heading toward financial ruin.

DIM_agrarische_wet_title;The Agrarische Wet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_agrarische_wet_desc;While vital for the financial well-being of our nation, the Cultuurstelsel has its opponents. Especially in liberal circles there is a lot of criticism of the system. They view the Cultuurstelsel as an inefficient and inflexible economic system, unable to respond adequately to changing circumstance. In their view the East Indies would benefit from opening up to private capital. The treatment of the Inlanders is also a point of contention. They hold the Cultuurstelsel as deeply immoral, as it denies the local education, Christianity and the blessings of progress. The Agrarische Wet seeks to abolish the Cultuurstelsel and its governmental plantations, and open the East Indies up to private investment. Ownership of the land is returned to the Inlanders and western individuals can lease lands from them or the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_cultuurstelsel_event_title;The Cultuurstelsel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_cultuurstelsel_event_desc;Replacing the old Landrente-tax, which required farmers to pay 2/5th of their harvest as tax, the Cultuurstelsel requires farmers to use 1/5th of their land to grow cash crops, mainly coffee, tea, sugar and indigo. Farmers who cannot grow these crops on their land are required to provide the Herendienst: 60 days of free labour per year to work on government plantations. Should the value of crops exceed the previously paid Landrente, the farmer is compensated accordingly by the Plantloon. To reduce the financial burden on the colonial administration, a system of local middleman, mainly Chinese, has been set up to handle the system. Furthermore, to tie local Heads to our administration, they are awarded a certain percentage of the crops called the Cultuurprocenten. To stimulate production, the Cultuurprocenten goes up the more is produce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_suikerwet_title;The Suikerwet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_suikerwet_desc;The Agrarische Wet has been the first step in abolishing the cultuurstelsel. However due its economic importance, the sugar industry had been exempted from the Agrarische Wet. This never set well with the liberal elements of society, and they have always pushed to end the governmental monopoly on sugar. A bill has now been brought to a vote in parliament to this effect.\nUnder the Suikerwet the government relinquishes its monopoly on sugar, and opens the sugar market to private capital, provided the sugar is refined in Dutch refineries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_koffiewet_title;The Koffiewet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_koffiewet_desc;While in the days of the VOC spices such nutmeg and cloves might have been the economic motor of the Indies, since the late 18th century coffee has been the cork keeping our economy afloat. Therefore, when the Agrarische Wet was passed, the coffee cultures were specifically exempted. This never set right with the liberals and other proponents of a liberal economy. A bill has now been brought to a vote in parliament to finally bring an end to Cultuurstelsel, and the governmental monopoly on the coffee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_java_run_colony_desc;Long has our colony on Java been the envy of the world. The vast wealth provided by the Cultuurstelsel has propelled our nation forwards, and this has not gone unnoticed abroad. In a recently published book, called 'Java, or How to Manage a Colony,' the aptly named Englishman James Money described our colonial administration of Java, the Cultuurstelsel in particular, as the example of how a colony should be run. He writes that a similar system would solve many of the problems facing British India today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_javanese_famine_title;The Great Javanese Famine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_javanese_famine_desc;While famines are not unusual in that part of the world, the severity of the famine on Java has started to be noticed. Question have been raised whether or not perhaps the Cultuurstelsel lies at the heart of the problem. Investigation has revealed multiple issues at play which may have contributed to the famine: While the official instruction is that leeway has to be given for the production of food, this is frequently ignored. Enticed by the Cultuurprocenten, their share of the proceeds, local administrators and Heads push farmers to work the plantations instead of their rice paddies. Farmers are often required to use their most productive lands to grow cash crops, and lastly, it would that in some instances farmers are even forced to set aside more than the 1/5th of their land required under the Cultuurstelsel to cash crops. This combined with natural forces have likely conspired to cause the current famine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Originally intended to provide labour to government plantations, the system is now widely used for other purposes. As it happens the region around $PROVINCENAME$ has been suffering from a lack of investment, leaving the roads dilapidated, hampering local trade. Furthermore, the fortress at $PROVINCENAME$ has not seen any major work done in years. Lastly the local regent has complained his residence is no longer representative of a man of his position. We could divert the labours away from the plantations to remedy one of these issues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_cultuurstelsel_famine_title;Famine in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_cultuurstelsel_famine_desc;'To those who blame the Cultuurstelsel for the famine in $PROVINCENAME$ we say: When Jacob sent his sons to Egypt to buy grain, it was due to famine. And yet history does not record the existence of a Cultuurstelsel in Israel. When the prophet Nathan threatened David with the disaster, he threatened him with famine, yet we do not read that the prophet threatened to inflict the Cultuurstelsel on David's kingdom. Europe too was ravished by famine before the potato, and British India still is. The famine striking the Indies cannot be blamed on the Cultuurstelsel, which if applied wisely, spreads prosperity, not famine. We must blame the famine in $PROVINCENAME$ on local misrule. On local Heads who extract to much tax, and do not pay the dessa occupants their due Plantloon.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_cultuurstelsel_escape_title;People moving out of $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_cultuurstelsel_escape_desc;One of the strengths of the Cultuurstelsel is its ability to be adapted to the local polity. By including the Heads in the system, by offering the Cultuurprocenten, their interests align with ours. Their influence and coordinating abilities are thus fully employed to make the Cultuurstelsel a success. This also means the system can, in broad lines, be applied to any region, with the local Heads adapting it to their specific circumstance. Some local variation in the system thus exists. The Cultuurstelsel in  $PROVINCENAME$ is a particular efficient variety. However the local populace disagrees, and has started leaving $PROVINCENAME$ looking for a more liberal implementation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_cultuurstelsel_multatuli1_title;Overzealous Colonial Officer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_cultuurstelsel_multatuli1_desc;One of our lower colonial officers, an assistant-resident in western Java, has taken a very zealous approach to his job. Disturbed by the abuses of the Cultuurstelsel and Herendienst he found in his regency, he accused the local Head of severe abuse of power and bondage of his subjects. While of course his position requires him to reign in local excesses and protect the populace, his primary concern should be the protection of our interests! Currently, the authority of the Head is sacred and unquestionable to the populace. Bringing him to court might cause severe social upheaval. As such, the Resident has called the Assistent-Resident to order and stopped the prosecution of the Head. This did not deter the Assistent-Resident. The case has now reached the Governor-General who has to decided to continue the prosecution, and risk rebellion, or put a stop to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_cultuurstelsel_multatuli2_title;Disgruntled Colonial Officer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_cultuurstelsel_multatuli2_desc;A former colonial officer who left the service after an altercation with a local Regent, has now written to you complaining about the treatment he has received. A fervent liberal and proponent of inlander rights, he claims to have written a book detailing abuses committed by both the colonial government and local Heads under the Cultuurstelsel. Having been reduced to poverty by his treatment, he is threatening to publish this book unless he is fully rehabilitated, which in this case means: a position of Regent on Java, full restoration of his pension, a large advance and, most preposterously, a decoration for his 'service.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_max_havelaar_title;Multatuli;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_max_havelaar_desc;'I am broker in coffee, and live on the Lauriersgracht No. 37.'\nWith these words begins the novel Max Havelaar, which has by now 'sent a shudder through the land.' The novel describes the consequences of the colonial system in Java, in which government and local Heads cooperated to enrich themselves at the expense of the people. In the example of the body of the Javanese, murdered on the orders of the regent, floating down the river as a present from the sharks of the interior to the sharks in the sea, after that poor wretch had complained about the Regent, the 'humdrum' story of that one buffalo of Saidjah's father, the village in Lampung set ablaze by Dutch forces. Cumulating in the majestic, almost terrifying, final chord in which Multatuli exposed Holland as a 'pirate state' among the nations, and conjured the king not to tolerate any longer that more than 30 million Javanese are maltreated and exploited in his name in the 'glorious realm of Insulinde, that coiled round the Equator like a girdle of emerald.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_batavia_revolutie_title;The Batavian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_batavia_revolutie_desc;Inspired by events in Europe, a group of prominent citizens has gather in Batavia to protest our educational policy, or more specifically the lack thereof, in the East. Leaving most without any education whatsoever. Those who can afford it, Europeans and Indo-Europeans alike, resort to sending their children to the Motherland for an expensive private education. This is almost an legal requirement, as only those who have studied at the Royal Academy in Delft are eligible for official posts in the East. The protesters are now demanding the revision of the educational system: the end of the 'Delft Monopoly,' the opening of more and better schools, and the end of the discrimination against Indo-Europeans. Furthermore they are demanding more personal and economic freedoms: freedom of the press, the end of the autocratic government, a liberalisation of trade, the end of slavery, and the revision of the local currency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_cultuurstelsel_hoevell_title;Baron Van Hoevell;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_cultuurstelsel_hoevell_desc;'People of the Netherlands, does a bloodguilt not burn on your consciousness? For two centuries has your flag flow on Java: For two centuries you have waived the sceptre of domination: Millions upon millions have flowed to your treasure on the toiling of the inlanders: And you have returned nothing to them.' \n Member of Parliament Wolter Robert baron van Hoevell has emerged as one of the strongest critics of our colonial administration of Java and the Cultuurstelsel in particular. Originally serving as a minister in Batavia, he was forced to leave the Indies due to his liberal and anti-governmental tendencies. Very popular in the Indies: it is said that when he left, he was sent of by 'half of Batavia.' As one of the few MPs who has actually visited the Indies, he can describe the situation there with great expertise and 'disturbing eloquence.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_pangka_title;Colonial contract up for tender;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_pangka_desc;Under the Cultuurstelsel private contracts are signed for the refining of the sugar. Now one of the most lucrative contracts on Java has expired and is up for tender again. We've been approached by close associates of us who ask to forgo the normal tender procedure, and award the contract directly to them. Such a arrangement will pose no legal hurdles. More worrisome, however, is that they have requested a governmental credit line to bridge the gap between the awarding of the contract and the actual operating of the refinery. Due to the distance between the Motherland and the Indies, such requests are not unreasonable. The more liberal elements of society might not take kindly to such governmental interference in the market though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_pangka_affair_title;The Pangka Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_pangka_affair_desc;Under the Cultuurstelsel private contracts are signed for the refining of the sugar. As these contracts are some of the most lucrative colonial contracts, there is always a lot of interest when they are up for tender. Shady dealings revolving around the awarding of the highly lucrative Pangka contract has now evolved into a public scandal. Under pressure from the king, the contract was awarded without tender to a royal associate, and a governmental line of credit extended. The contracting party then promptly sold their contract for a sum vastly greater than they had originally paid for it, duping the treasury. Worse still is that, due to legal problems resulting from this, the refinery has not been able to operate for some time, leaving valuable loads of sugar unprocessed.\nParliament has long since been fed up with the monkey business surrounding the awarding of the sugar contracts. The weak performance of the minister has now giving parliament the impetus to demand reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_regeringsregelement_title;Indisch Regeringsregelement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_regeringsregelement_desc;The East Indies is de facto ruled as an absolute monarchy with the Governor-General as 'King.' This has long been a point of contention for liberals. The Regeringsregelement aims to bring the government of the East Indies under parliamentary scrutiny. Furthermore it reforms and limits the spread of the Cultuurstelsel (to ease the suffering of the inlanders), puts a limit on the Herendienst, offers freedom of religion, settles issues of race and promises to end slavery in the East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_regeringsregelement_zending_title;Missions in the East Indies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_regeringsregelement_zending_desc;There have been few limits imposed on Christian mission in the East Indies. In the past, this often lead to friction between the various denomination, especially when operating in the same region. The Christianization of the East has been hampered by this. The missions also had a tendency to chose more sensitive area's as basis of operation, greatly upsetting the local populace. The Regeringsregelement attempts to remedy these issue's. Special permission has to be asked from the Governor-General before new missions can be started, and no two different missions may operate in the same region. The Regeringsregelement also allows for the Governor-General to declare some regions off-limits to missions, thus reducing unrest under the inlanders. The only question remains which denomination we will favour in the East. Will it be the Calvinists, our traditional religion, or shall we favour the Catholics, a historically repressed religion?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_regeringsregelement_tech_title;I should not be here;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_end_hadj_tax_title;End the Hajj Tax;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_end_hadj_tax_desc;The Hajj is the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca. It is considered the religious duty of every able-bodied Muslim, who can afford to do so, to attend the Hajj at least once in his life. Every Hajji is treated with the uttermost respect and is granted the right to wear a turban and Arabic clothing. Such is the respect for the Hajji that other Muslims will gladly take over their Herendienst. Most Hajjis become spiritual leaders, and try to educate the populace. Wherein exactly the problem lies. As the Padri wars showed, Hajjis can come back with dangerous new ideas and cause severe social unrest. To limit the number of Hajji's a steep tax was introduced. So steep in fact, that only 70 new Hajjis registered last year. As the Regeringsregelement provides for freedom of religion, some hold the Hajj Tax to be in violation of that principle and argue it should be abolished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_end_eastern_slavery_title;End slavery in the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_end_eastern_slavery_desc;Slavery in the East is not of the same style as slavery in the Americas. Slaves in the East are not primarily used on plantations, but instead are employed in the private households. Still a slavery is slavery, no matter the form. The Regeringsregelement has promised to abolish slavery in the East, and this is promise we should fulfil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DIM_cultuurgebied_oost_sumatra_title;Cultuurgebied Oost-Sumatra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_cultuurgebied_oost_sumatra_desc;Recent exploration of alluvial lowlands on the north east coast of Sumatra has revealed some of the most fertile lands in the archipelago. Fed by the run off of the volcanic highlands, the black soil is eminently suited to any number of crops, but the one particularly peaking the interest of planters is tobacco. They are asking us to open up the region to private investment and take a laissez-faire approach to economic development of the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_koelie_contracten_title;Koelie Contracten;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_koelie_contracten_desc;While the alluvial lowlands might provide some extremely fertile soil for our cash crops, they have never attracted a large population to settle there. Even today, the plentiful employment opportunities fail to attract sufficient labourers, hampering economic development in the region. Importing contract labourers, coolies, from Java, China and India might help alleviate the labour shortages, and strengthen our economic development there. Our colony in Guyana might also benefit from such an arrangement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_koelie_ordonnantie_title;The Koelie Ordonnantie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_koelie_ordonnantie_desc;For years we have been importing coolies, contract labourers, to work the plantations around Medan. However the local planters have not been satisfied with the labourers, claiming them to be lazy and unmotivated. Furthermore, the coolies do not seem to grasp the obligations placed on them by the contract. They will often leave the plantations without permission for unspecified amounts of time, sometimes never to return.\nThe planters are asking us to reform the judicial system, granting them extensive rights to discipline their labourers, and combat any perceived offence, in any way they deem fit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_colonial_question;The Koloniale Kwestie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_colonial_question_event_desc;'A weighty responsibility lies on the people blessed with such history as ours. Contemporaries and progeny might rightfully question, what we, sons of such a dearly bought freedom, have done with this freedom?

Is it but lies and slander that we exploit the Javanese?\n[...]\nThe Cultuurstelsel has made our country the disgrace of the world. We have surrendered the honour of being a civilised nation: for even the Spanish did not treat our forefathers so unchristian.'\nThat a moral nation pur sang like ours, which does not rely on brute force but moral superiority in international politics, should allow for her subjects to be exploited, has started to create a feeling of unease in society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_abandon_spices_title;End the Spice Monopoly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_abandon_spices_desc;A remand of the VOC period, the islanders on the Moluccans are required to deliver a predefined amount of spices (nutmeg and cloves in particular) each year, and are not allowed to trade with outside powers. Like the Cultuurstelsel, the Liberals consider it a distortion of the free market and a form of colonial oppression. Abandoning it will satisfy them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_landverhuurstelsel_title;The Landverhuurstelsel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_landverhuurstelsel_desc;Now the Dutch have established a full plantation system on Java, they are pressuring us to institute a plantation economy as well. More specifically, they are asking us to open up our lands to European exploitation. The plan as proposed will see us lease our lands to European planters, who will run, finance and organise the plantations, in exchange we will receive a share of the proceeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_korte_verklaring_title;The Korte Verklaring;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_korte_verklaring_desc;To protect our interests in the East against foreign powers, it has become time to strengthen our rule and abolish the native states throughout the archipelago. We've writen up a 'Korte Verklaring' (Short Declaration) which all inland princes will have to sign. The gist of which puts their state under our direct control. Any refusal will give us ample reason to invade them. [Note: In game-play terms this that over the coming years all Indonesian minors will get an event requiring them to join you. Refusal on their part gives you a CB on them. Note that minors which are vassals or in other SoI will not get the event until removed from that SoI/are no longer a vassal.] ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_kina_aanplant_title;The Cinchona Tree;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_kina_aanplant_desc;The bark of the Cinchona tree contains quinine, an important ingredient in malaria medicine. This makes the Cinchona tree invaluable to any nation pursuing an tropical venture. Currently, the tree only grows in Peru, and they guard their monopoly jealously. Increased demand over the years has led the tree to be overexploited, and the supply of this vital medicine can no longer be guaranteed. With some planning, we might be able to smuggle some plants out of Peru, and see if the plant will grow in the Indies. If it does, it will be of immense value to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_kina_aanplant_failed_title;Cinchona Tree does not take hold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_kina_aanplant_failed_desc;The Cinchona plants we smuggled out of Peru have failed to take hold in the East. It might be because they did not survive the trip, the care they received was inadequate, they were planted in the wrong location, or the Indies may very well be unsuited for the growth of the plant. Either way, without this plant it will be impossible to establish our own malaria medicine industry, and we will be subject to the whims of other powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_kina_aanplant_success_title;Cinchona Tree takes hold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_kina_aanplant_success_desc;We've successfully planted the Cinchona plants smuggled from Peru in the botanical garden at Buitenzorg.

DIM_belgium_java_run_colony_desc;In a recent book called 'Java, or How to Manage a Colony,' the aptly named Englishman John Money offers an insight into the Dutch colonial system on Java: the Cultuurstelsel. The plantations of coffee, sugar, tobacco and indigo have provided vast wealth to both the King and country. Virtually every venture the Dutch have undertaken over the past 30 years, from the canals and railroads of Holland, to the colonial wars in the east, has been paid for by the wealth extracted from Java. Despite relying heavily on forced labour, the author seems to be of the opinion that the natives do not mind as long as they are included in the march of civilisation. Combining these factors, he is of the opinion that the Cultuurstelsel is the best way to run a colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_unciv_deli_maatschappij_title;The Deli Maatschappij;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_unciv_deli_maatschappij_desc;We've been approached by a group of western investors who want to invest in the Medan area. The rich alluvial lowland plains along the north east coast of Sumatra, fed by volcanic run off from the highlands, are eminently suitable to the plantation of tobacco. The investors are seeking a long term land concession to start a tobacco plantation. They will finance, operate and organise the entire operation, all they ask from us is a signature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_knaud_kris_title;A Historic Kris;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_knaud_kris_desc;In South Asian culture, a kris (an asymmetrical, usually curvy, dagger) is a spiritual and sacred object. Imbued with magical powers, they are thought to be inhabited by spirits and as such are 'almost alive.' Care of krisses is subject to great ceremony and ritual. Should the owner be negligent, the Kris might kill him in his sleep. Should the owner, however, be generous, the kris will protect him and imbue him with valour.\nRecently, the crown-prince of one of our Princely States fell ill. Neither our western physicians, nor the local Dukun proved capable of helping. In a desperate move, the prince asked the renowned 'White Dukun,' a Dutchman educated in both western and indigenous medicine, for help. Finding it as a case of guna-guna, the White Dukun worked his magic and managed to cure the crown-prince. For his efforts in securing the succession, the prince awarded the White Dukun with his the most precious pusaka: an ancient kris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_flores_offer_desc;The Portuguese still hold sway over a small part of the East Indies: Timor and Flores. We've fought many wars over these territories, and Lisbon's presence there remains a thorn in our side. These territories had previously important outposts of Lisbon, but are by now very impoverished, and have little connection with to the Motherland. Perhaps we should approach the Portuguese to see if they are willing to sell their possessions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_flores_POR_offer_title;Dutch Embassy for the East Indies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_flores_POR_offer_desc;We've received a Dutch Embassy intend on settling our territorial issues in the East Indies. Throughout history we've fought many wars for control over Flores and Timor, and have now more or less settled on the Dutch controlling western Flores and western Timor and us controlling eastern Flores and eastern Timor. The Dutch have since greatly expanded their control over the archipelago, and are extracting vast wealth from the region. Our territories on the other hand are greatly impoverished, and our control over them is limited. Selling them would not be a great loss to us, were it not for the fact that we would lose all influence in the region.

DIM_flores_dili_offer_desc;The Portuguese governor at Dilli has approached our resident in Kaupeng with on offer to sell their possessions on Flores and the Alor Islands to us. Dilli already was a forgotten outpost of the Portuguese empire, its economic importance disappeared long ago. Following the depletion of the sandalwood stocks on the islands, the last pillar of the economy disappeared. Faced with an impoverished administration and no support from Lisbon, he has now turned to us for help. It is clear he is acting without consent of Lisbon, but that does not have to matter.

DIM_bonjol_desc;The Padri town of Bonjol has proven to be a difficult town to raze. The entire town was surrounded by an impregnable hedge of thorny bamboo, which proved to be invulnerable to artillery fire. The northern flank is furthermore protected by a large swamp, while the eastern edge was too forested to launch an assault from. On the western flank, a large hill protected the town, which proved especially difficult to approach due to it facing a ravine. The town had proven so resistant to our assaults, that some of our soldiers had simply taken up farming: they weren't going anywhere.\nHowever we finally managed to draw the Padri away from the defenses, allowing our soldiers to take a number of important positions close to the town. With pressure mounting, the Padris started to flee the city.\nWith Bonjol, capital of the Padris, in our hands, we are sure to have broken their power in the Padang Highlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_padri_vict_desc;The Padri war started as a religious conflict between the Islamic Padris and the moderate Adats. The Padri sect emerged when Hadji's returned from Mecca, and wanted to reform Minangkabau society along Wahabistic lines. Appalled by the prevalence of gambling and drinking among the Minangkabau people, the matrilinear nature of society did not sit well with them either. To effect change, the Padris started a campaign of violence. They are responsible for the death of two sultans, with the third sultan only barely managing to escape. To save his kingdom, and his position, he appealed to us to stop the Padris. Now we have broken the Padris, the sultan surely expects us to restore his kingdom to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_form_mataram_sultanate_NET_desc;The recent developments in the Princely States can only be viewed as an attack on our rule on Java. In the historical context, the division between Surakarta and Yogyakarta is purely artificial and imposed by us to break up the Mataram Sultanate. Their unification can only mean the sultans seek to restore the Mataram sultanate. We should intervene now before they manage to rebuild their strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_surakarta_badad_madura_title;The Badad Madura;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_surakarta_badad_madura_desc;Madura has always been a subject state of the Mataram Sultanate, and just a few years ago these ties were reaffirmed by a truly glorious royal marriage: All of Surakarta, even the Dutch and Chinese homes, was decorated with banners, offerings, and paper lanterns. The lanterns lighted the city like a volcano ablaze, a sea of flames. After reciting the nikah, 'waves of amen poured into the courtyard,' where they were echoed by crows, drums corps and cannon salutes throughout the city. The wedding procession through the alliterative glitter of lanterns and gamelan orchestras drew the entire city into the rite. Instead of the customary wedding gift of vegetables, exquisitely crafted gold peppers and silver eggplants embellished with copper-alloy foliage constituted the 'sasrahan raja' (king's wedding gift).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_mataram_badad_madura_desc;Madura has always been a subject state of Mataram, and just a few years ago these ties were reaffirmed by a royal marriage.

DIM_PLB_suppression_title;The Sultanate of Palembang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_PLB_suppression_desc;Relations with Palembang have always been troublesome, but things have taken a turn for the worst since the English period. They had installed a new sultan, one which proved to be friendly to their interests, but not so much to ours. The confrontation (the recent Palembang expeditions) was inevitable, and so was our victory. Through these expeditions we've managed to install a sultan more favourable to our interests, but his authority outside of the city of Palembang is limited. Brigands and robbers roam the country side, and the local Heads appear unwilling or unable to control them. Our commissionaire in the sultanate has expressed his desire to take a more direct role in ruling the state, and has asked us to enter into a new contract with the sultan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_PLB_integration_title;Unrest in Palembang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_PLB_integration_desc;We had hoped our recent treaty with the sultan of Palembang would have stabilised the region, and would have create a solid basis for stable relations. Alas, our hopes were in vain: the sultan has proven to extremely unreliable. He has long since stopped paying our due taxes, and it would seem he ordered the recent assassination of our commissionaire to the sultanate. But all this is irrelevant as it would appear the sultan has ordered his forces to siege our fort in Palembang. To restore order, and maintain our authority, something has to be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_PLB_should_I_stay_or_should_I_go_desc;In responds to our recent aggressive moves against them, the Dutch have decided to outfit a military expedition to 'restore [their] order' on our lands. We can hardly defend against the Dutch might, it is time to flee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_PLB_flees_title;Palembang Sultan flees!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_PLB_flees_desc;Fearing our great military might, the Sultan of Palembang has decided to flee his realm, but was captured by one of our patrols and exiled to Bangka. His father has met our forces outside of the Kraton and has surrender himself to our forces. With both possible claimants to the throne under our sway, the Sultanate of Palembang de facto ceases to exist. We can abolish the sultanate and institute direct rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_buitenzorg_destroyed_title;The Salak Eruption of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_buitenzorg_destroyed_desc;Mount Salak on Java has erupted, and the related earthquake has destroyed the Buitenzorg palace! The palace has served as capital of the Indies since the time of Raffles. And its cool mountain climate make a far more habitable place than the oppressive marsh climate of Batavia. The building, standing at three stories tall while there are only a handful of buildings taller than 1 floor in the entire archipelago, was a truly magnificent sight, and symbol of our rule in the Indies. It deserves a worthy replacement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_buitenzorg_paleis_title;The Buitenzorg Palace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_buitenzorg_paleis_desc;The Buitenzorg Palace has served as main administrative centre for the East Indies since the middle of the 18th century, but was destroyed by an earthquake in 1834. We have finally finished rebuilding the palace. The original palace had three floors, but, as future protection against earthquakes, the new palace only has one. Of particular importance is ''s Lands Plantentuin' (the botanical gardens) surrounding the palace. Originally founded as a forest for rare species of plants during the Sunda Kingdom, they currently serve a primary research institute for the development and cultivation of new species of plants. As such, it is one of the most important institutes of tropical research in the world, and of vital importance to the plantation economy on Java.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_fortdubus_title;Fort du Bus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_fortdubus_desc;The island of New Guinea is a vast land inhabited by savages. No real exploration of the land or her people has ever been attempted, even though we hold a claim to the land through our vassal Tidore. As English explorers started appear of the Papuan coast, the need to establish a permanent settlement and safeguard our claim became apparent. Under the guise of a naturalist expedition a fortification was build on the south coast of New Guinea in 1828: Fort du Bus. The fort has fulfilled its purpose and strengthened our claim to the region.\nUnfortunately the fort proved to be less than successful. The Triton Bay has proven to a disease ridden region, and many an officer sent to the fort has fallen to malaria. And if disease does not kill the unfortunate sod sent to the fort, raiders will: Fearful of losing their trading position with the Papua's, the fort is continuously harassed by Moluccan traders. It has been suggested we'd abandon the fort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_etna_expedition_title;The Etna Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_etna_expedition_desc;Aside from the small presence at Fort du Bus, we've had no real presence on the New Guinea, and the islands remains virtually unknown to us. Scientist have long been pushing for a naturalist expedition to this unknown land. We can sent an expedition to explore the coastal regions, which might also give us insight into future locations for governmental posts. [The expedition will last approximately 8 months.];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_NET_etna_expedition_returns_desc;The expedition we've sent to explore the coast of New Guinea has returned. In the past few months they have made extensive maps of the coast of New Guinea: not only of the currents and water depths, but also of suitable locations for future posts. Invaluable information to us should we decide to expand to that vast land. On the naturalist side the expedition was less successful. A large number of hitherto unknown species of birds were discovered, and promptly killed for preservation. Aside from those samples large collection of stones and minerals was brought back. However, no grand new discoveries were made. Rather unexpectedly the expedition ran into an English naturalist called Wallace at an isolated German mission post. The man is doing research into the development of species, and claims to be on the verge of a major scientific breakthrough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In the past few months they have made extensive maps of the coast of New Guinea: not only of the currents and water depths, but also of suitable locations for future posts. Invaluable information to us should we decide to expand to that vast land. On the naturalist side the expedition was fairly routine. A few new bird species discovered, some interesting rocks found. Nothing to get to excited about. That is untill, rather unexpectedly, the expedition ran into an English naturalist called Wallace at an isolated German mission post. The man has been travelling the archipelago to research, what he calls, the introduction of new species. Impressed by how well our expedition was outfit, he saw an opportunity for collaboration and joined the expedition. Claiming to be on the verge of a major scientific breakthrough, he has promised to give credit where credit is due.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_etna_expedition_failure_success_desc;The expedition we've sent to explore the coast of New Guinea has returned, early. The expedition had started out well, successfully mapping the currents and depth of the western part of the island, and gather a few naturalist samples. However, on one of the naturalist excursions into the forest, the expedition members disappeared! The soldiers sent into the forest after them, could not locate them. Later at night, bright fires could be seen deep in the forests, with loud noises emerging from it. We can only assume the worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_invades_palembang_title;Sultan of Djambi invades Palembang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_invades_palembang_desc;Our resident at Palembang has successfully been courting the Sultan of Djambi in the hopes of having him submit to our authority. The position of the Sultan of Djambi has never been very secure, with various factions at court vying for power. Our Resident has successfully managed to exploit this by offering our authority and resources to help him secure his position. A welcome opportunity for the beleaguered sultan. However negotiations seems to have stalled the last few months, and the sultan has taken the initiative and come to Palembang. He claims to be on a peaceful mission, but his actions seem to indicate the opposite. At the head of a column of hundreds, if not thousands, of men, he has taken owner ship of the disputed lands along the border, and is moving on Palembang. Traders have been harassed by Djambian nobles, and worse, a letter adressed to the former sultan of Palembang has been intercepted, offering to restore him. This requires immediate action!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_sues_for_peace_title;Sultan of Djambi sues for peace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_sues_for_peace_desc;The sultan of Djambi has sent peace envoys to our forces. It would seem the nobles at his court have started revolting, with some refusing to supply rice to the sultan's forces. Other nobles are reported to be abusing the salt shortage caused by the war to plot against the sultan. Sufficient to say, the sultan's position has been severely weakened by this war. And he is now ready to enter into treaty with us. He has offered to place all foreign affairs under our suzerainty, as well as control over exports, in exchange for the financial resources to subdue his nobles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_said_mohamad_title;The Case of Said Mohamad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_said_mohamad_desc;A noble of one of the suku has been arrested by Dutch! Accusing him of murder! Not only is this a clear violation of our treaty, they have also breached the adat. It is the royal prerogative to punish any nobles, and the Dutch actions are a great offence to us and our prestige. Understandably the nobles are up in arms about this, as it is also a violation of their rights and position. They are preparing to attack a Dutch post on the coast. The situation is starting to get out of control, and something has to be done. However, stopping them will damage our standing, and possibly turn them against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_said_mohamad_NET_title;The Case of Said Mohamad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_said_mohamad_NET_desc;The new colonial administrator in Djambi has taken it onto himself to arrest a noble of one of the suku on charges of murder. The arrest, even if it were justified, can only be considered extremely tactless. Our treaty with the sultan is limited to foreign trade and matters of succession. Internal matters are strictly off-limits. Worse still the local adat reserves the right to punish nobles exclusively to the sultan. Outraged by the perceived attack on their custom and position, the Djambian nobles have now taken up arms against us and attack one of our posts. While the post held, this attack on our authority requires a responds!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_replace_sultan_NET_title;Replace the Sultan of Djambi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_replace_sultan_NET_desc;Our contract with the Sultan of Djambi gives us full control of foreign trade, while he maintains full sovereignty over internal matters. However, such is the poverty of the sultanate, that only the salt monopoly is profitable to us. Recent unrest in sultanate, caused by the weak position of the sultan vis-a-vis the suku (noble families), has turned to near open rebellion. The sultan is either unwilling or unable to quell the opposition, and to secure our position in the sultanate, we may need to turn to somebody else. Both the pangeran ratu (crown prince) and the suku Kraton have significant power-bases, and might provide a more stable sultan. Shall we replace the Sultan with either of these?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_support_padri_title;Support the Padris;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_support_padri_desc;For the past decade the Padris have been fighting an insurrection against the Dutch. Originally the war started as an insurrection of the fundamentalist Padris who rebelled against the 'un-Islamic' adats (customs) of the Minangkabau people. When the Minangkabau Sultan turned to the Dutch for assistance, the rebellion took on the character of a popular revolt against the Dutch. We can offer to support the Padris in exhange for our ancestral claim on Siguntur;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_surrender_decision_title;Sue for peace with the Dutch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_surrender_decision_desc;The war with the Dutch is not going well. The blockade of the coast is leading to a shortage of salt, and discontentment among the population. What is worse, our enemies at court are abusing this discontentment to plot against us, and our unreliable vassals are refusing to supply our forces with rice. Perhaps it is best to enter into a treaty with the Dutch, surrendering some of our rights in exchange for the resources to fend of the rebelling nobles?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_flee_highlands_title;Flee to the highlands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_flee_highlands_desc;The war is not going well, not well at all. The coast is difficult to hold, but the interiour mountain ranges will surely allow us to continue our resistance. We should withdraw to the mountains. Our will surely not follow us into the rugged interiour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_NET_djambi_fractures_desc;While we've been able to compel the Djambian sultan to accept our suzerainty, not all factions at court have always accepted this. One of the leaders has now broken with the Djambian sultan, and taken to the highlands to 're-establish the true Djambi Sultanate.' Taking the most important Djambian pusaka (heirlooms) with him, he has convinced a large part of the population to support him over our sultan. The highlands are virtually unknown to us, and pursuing him there will be a long and hard process. We might satisfy us with just controlling the capital and coastal regions, or sent an expedition into the highlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_DJA_flee_highlands_NET_desc;The Sultan of Djambi, realising he could not resist our superior strength, has fled into the highlands. He has taken his whole court and all pusaka (heirlooms) with him, and it would seem he plans on establishing a new sultanate there. These lands are virtually unknown to us, and pursuing him there will be a long and hard process. We might satisfy us with just controlling the capital and coastal regions, or sent an expedition into the highlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_new_sultan_NET_title;The new Sultan of Djambi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_new_sultan_NET_desc;The old Sultan of Djambi has passed away, and a new one is ready to ascend to the throne. By treaty, any new sultan has to be confirmed by us. Such a change of guard always creates opportunities to strengthen our hold on the sultanate. Until now we may have been content with a hands off approach to the Outer Islands, however, James Brooke of Sarawak and those like him have proven this to be a vulnerable arrangement. This change of guard might be a good opportunity to strengthen our rule in the Sultanate, and reduce the risk of adventures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_sultan_killed_NET_title;Sultan of Djambi Killed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_DJA_sultan_killed_NET_desc;Ever since we integrated the Sultanate of Djambi into our country, the old sultan has been nothing but trouble. Raiding our posts, setting the populace against us. And using his intimate knowledges of the interiour forests and mountain ranges to stay one step ahead of our forces. Until one of our patrols finally managed to catch up to him today. Determined not to be taken alive, he fought valiantly to the end. With him out of the way, the whole sultanate naturally reverts back to the sultan under our control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_IDG_unrest_NET_desc;The Sultan of Indragiri has come into conflict with his representative of the court of Riau-Lingga. As the Sultan of Lingga is our vassal, it is only natural we have been approached to mediate in the dispute. While the exact nature of the dispute remains a bit murky, it is clear the Sultan of Indragiri wants more autonomy, more than the Sultan of Lingga is willing to grant. As the Sultan of Lingga is completely reliant on us for his power, it should not be difficult to create an arrangement favourable to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The battle lines are being drawn, and the situation turning to open conflict. The Sultan of Indragiri has now turned to us for help, hoping we van force the Sultan of Lingga to back down.\nAchieving this would not be difficult. However, the Sultan of Lingga is a Dutch vassal, and they will not take kindly to us meddling in their affairs. Furthermore we relinquished our claims to, and the right to establish outposts on, Sumatra to the Dutch by our treaty of 1824. By intervening we would be violating this treaty, and the world might not look kindly on this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_ENG_east_indies_trade_desc;We've been approach by merchants from Singapore and other Strait Settlements worried about their trade within the East Indies. The East Indies trade is of great importance to the Straits Settlements: currently 1/5th of their trade is with the East Indies, and the ratio of British to Dutch imports on Java stands at 6:7. Under the Treaty of 1824 we are regarded as most favourable nation, and are granted equal trade rights in the archipelago.\nThe merchants hold Dutch trade policy to be not based on supremacy through competition, but on occupation, cession and treaty with native princes. As such they are always weary of Dutch expansion. Recent treaties between the Dutch and Sumatran princes have imposed new tariffs and monopolies on the trade, threatening Singapore's trade. The merchants are requesting us to intervene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_ENG_british_protest_title;The British East Indies Trade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_ENG_british_protest_desc;We've received a communique from London containing an official protest to our trade policy in the East Indies in general, and Sumatra in particular. Spurred on by traders from Singapore, who are currently dependent on trade with our colonies, London holds our treaties with the sultans of Sumatra to violate the Treaty of 1824. Under the treaty the British are granted status of most favoured nation, and we have extended extensive trade rights to them.

Currently 1/5th of their trade is with the Indies, and the ratio of British to our imports on Java is 6:7.\nHowever, it would seem London values our good relations more that the narrow self-interest of the Singapore traders, and have decided not to pursue the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

After defeating the Makassar Empire, the VOC elevated the Boni kingdom to foremost kingdom on Celebes. Not interested in developing the lands, or even the trade, in as much as the VOC was interested in keeping others out. They never obstructed the Boni them from extending their suzerainty over the other Bunginese states, as long as it submitted to the VOC monopoly. This has left the economic potential of the region untouched, and over the past few years we've been trying to remedy this situation. The lesser Bunginese states are very enthusiastic, but the Boni kings have been resistant to any proposal limiting their power. Even to the point of battle. Perhaps it is time to consider our options?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_new_bungai_treaty_event_desc;We have the following options in regard to the Boni Kingdom:\n-Demand full compliance. [Boni releases all vassals, and all provinces get an economic boost.]\n-Offer a compromise.

When the old king of Boni died his successor, his widow, professed to desire warmer relations, yet her recent actions speak differently. She has ordered all trading ships to fly our flag upside down, she is inciting the local heads to revolt against us, and has already succeeded in turning some inlander auxiliaries to revolt. But, what is worse, she has resurrected the old 'Zilverenverbond' (silver alliance) of the Bunginese kingdoms. It is all but certain she is preparing for war against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As our treaty of protection with the sultan requires our consent in all matters of succession, we should use this opportunity to our advantage.\nThe sultan has proposed his grandson prince Hidayatullah as his successor, the most popular of all candidates. He is a devout Muslim or great moral character. His strict interpretation of the Islam makes him very popular among the general populace and the clergy. Another candidate is Prince Tamjidillah, eldest son of prince Abdurrahaman. He is enamoured by the western style of life, especially alcohol, and shows a preference for our rule. However his lax interpretation of Islam makes him unpopular among the clergy, and his Chinese mother upsets the aristocrats.

DIM_BAJ_unrest_NET_desc;Our choice as successor in the Sultanate of Bandjar has long been unpopular with the populace. While the unrest was originally directed against the new sultan, the anger has now turned against our presence there.

After receiving the delegation the local Head and his entourage quickly attacked them with klewangs (a local type of sword). Alert by the commotion caused by this, the unrust was quickly swamped by prauws (piragua) who embarked hundreds of rebels on the ship.

DIM_pil_bandoeng_desc;Malaria is an ever present danger in the tropical regions of the world. There are few effective treatments for the disease, and those which do exist are expensive. Our control over the production of Quinine from the Cinchona tree has given our citizens abundant and relatively cheap access to the medicine. However, the inlander population has been unable to profit from this, and continues to be ravaged by the disease. A bill has been proposed in parliament to fund the construction of a large Quinine factory on Java. This factory will be specifically to supply the natives with this important medicine, and extend the benefits of Dutch civilisation to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_tabacco_betuwe_title;Tobacco Cultures in the Netherlands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_tabacco_betuwe_desc;The countryside in Gelderland and southern Utrecht has a long an proud tradition of tobacco growing, dating back to the 1620s. The industry has declined somewhat from its height in the 18th century, yet remains an important economic sector to this day. Over the past decades it has even shown a sort of resurgence. However the industry is threatened by imports from the colonies. Not only do the rich alluvial plains of Sumatra provide better soil and climate, the labour situation gives the colonies a distinct advantage as well.\nThe future of the tobacco cultivation will have be decided in the near future, and the issue has become a major electoral issue in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_stovia_title;The School tot Opleiding van Inlandsche Artsen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_stovia_desc;We have always kept medical professions in the Indies a strictly western affair. There have been hospitals and doctors for inlanders, but never any inlander doctors and physicians. This has obviously had a negative effect on the access to modern medical care for inlanders. Most are now surrendered to the whims of the dukuns, and the magic and superstition they perpetrate. To combat this, and improve the plight of our colonial subjects, it has been suggested we start training inlanders in the medical profession.\n\n[A second inlander medical, the Nederlandsch-Indische Artsen School or N.I.A.S., would later be founded in Soerabaja.];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The society considers it a great sin that, in our name, Javanese should be exploited. Being the foremost Christian nation under God, it should fall to us to uplift the inlanders! Perhaps under our guidance can the Javanese can do away with their superstitions and join the ranks of civilised peoples. The society has started to raise money to fund (Christian) schools in the East.\nThe paternalistic nature of the society, however, has not fallen well with more liberal elements of our society. Multatuli, perhaps the foremost 'friend of the Javanese,' has published a damning commentary of their work: 'He who does indeed value Civilisation does not ridicule her by spreading more or less illustrated school books, prints and atlases to those who he systematically exploits, abuses and murders.' ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_de_cock_desc;Influenced by the Enlightenment the Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk (Dutch Reformed Church) has been evolving towards a more liberal and rational interpretation of the bible. A development loved by some, and loathed by others. The countryside in particular remains a stronghold of the more orthodox teachings. Those ministers preaching, against official doctrine, a more orthodox interpretation of the bible are sure to find a flock there.\nA young minister by the name of de Cock has started baptising believers in accordance with a more orthodox interpretation of the bible, and people have been flocking to him. This is causing some friction with, and resentment of, other ministers in the region following the official doctrine. They have removed de Cock from the official register, and forbidden him from preaching. He has now travelled to The Hague to plead his case, and asks for the government to help him be reinstated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_afscheiding_1834_desc;Tensions have been running high of late within the Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk (Dutch Reformed Church). Under the ideals of enlightenment the church has started to follow a more liberal and rational interpretation of the Bible. This has let to some members turning away from the establishment and look for more orthodox ministers. These apostates have now come together and organised their own church, or rather a replacement church. They claim that they, and only they, are the tre followers of Calvin, and only they can be called the true Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk. All those who don't follow them are heretics in their eyes. Unsurprisingly, this has led to some friction, and the government now has to take a stance on the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_afscheiding_1834_end_prosecution_desc;Some years ago a schism happened in the Dutch Reformed Church, with the more orthodox part seceding to form their own congregation. Spurred on by those following the official (liberal) doctrine, we have taken extreme measures to try and 'curb the evil.' The leader of the seccessionist, dominee de Cock, has been imprisoned, and we have dispersed every sermon we could, fined those in attendance and billeted soldiers in their homes. All to no avail, as the movement is still going strong. Perhaps it is time to end this prosecution, and accept they are going their own way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

And while he may be most famous for his portait work, he has shown remarkable skill in painting landscapes as well. Often depicting exotic scenes from his homeland, offering an insight into a world unknown to most Europeans.

DIM_NET_raden_saleh_desc;Raden Saleh is an Javanese painter has made quite a name for himself in the courts of Europe.  This 'Eastern Prince,' son of a noble family, has studied the modern European painting techniques under our patronage, and is possibly the first oriental to do so. He has shown particular aptitude towards painting portraits, and many a ruler has been immortalised by his work. His landscapes too are a sight to behold. Inspired by his native land, the paintings show exquisite detail in the wild animals he depicts. But perhaps his most important work is his depiction of the capture of Prince Diponegoro at the Java war, provocatively depicting a noble prince Diponegoro and slightly 'unbalanced' colonial officers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The landlords, feeling deprived of their rightful income, have rioted and torched a soup kitchen. The soup kitchen has been temporarily used to store property of not paying landlords. Apparently they rather saw their own property destroyed rather than paying the tax.\n\nPlenty blame to go around as to how this could have happened. The guards, 60 militiamen, had taken refuge inside due to rain and were caught by surprise, the mayor was nowhere to be seen to seen to take control of the situation, and the local garrison commander, well, he was on holiday for the weekend, leaving no one to direct the garrison to intervene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

There was a ship loaded with potato's docked in $CAPITAL$. There was, not is, because the riffraff got jealous, and, abandoning all dignity, plundered our valuable military supplies.

DIM_NHM_title;A New Trading Company;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NHM_desc;Long has our nation known a great trading spirit. From the 'Moedernegotie' (the Baltic grain trade), to the Spice Trade in the East Indies, to the slave and sugar trade in the West Indies, to Dejima and the trade with Japan, Dutch merchants have sailed the 7 seas and dominated the trade wherever they went. However our great trading tradition was disrupted when then VOC went out of business, and further wiped out by the French take over and their 'Continental System.' Trade has only been slow to recover since the French withdraw, and the English have started to emerge as the new great trading power of the age. Even in our own colonies! To remedy this situation and return our nation to the foremost trading nations, a proposal to fund a new trading company has been put forward. A company to finance import and export, maintain and engaging in new trade relations and find new markets: de Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij. The real question is, what markets will it focus on?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NHM_overstretched_desc;The worldwide focus we have given the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij has started to wear it down. The company is under-capitalised to preform in a world wide function, and furthermore continuous losses due to the world wide focus have brought the company to the verge of bankruptcy. As state we can of course absorb all losses of the company and recapitalise it, or try to refocus it on more viable markets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NHM_industrie_title;The Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NHM_industrie_desc;The secession of Belgium from our country has had severe economic effects. The industrial motor of the country lies in what is now Belgium, and so do the capital investments associated with them. The what are now Belgian provinces have always been the preferred destination for capital investment, and what are left of our lands are now severely under-capitalised. However, partly due to the Cultuurstelsel, the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij has shown a great surplus over the past few years. It has been suggested we should reinvest these profits into the economy, the textile trade in the east of the country in particularly. However we can also skim the profits into the treasury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_kleine_compagnie_title;The 'Kleine Compagnie';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_kleine_compagnie_desc;The Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, founded to reinvigorate Dutch trade, has had a major influence on the trade with the East Indies. Due to its effectiveness in trading the goods produced under the Cultuurstelsel, the company has managed to reinvigorate our economy, and our that of our colony. It is so effective that, in reverence of the older and greater Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, the inlanders have started refering to the company as the 'Kleine Compagnie' (the little company).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NHM_banking_title;Refocus the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NHM_banking_desc;The Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij has turned out to be an incredibly successful trading company. So much so that the company has been unable to reinvest all earnings back into the trading business, and has grown to be ever more invested in the financing business. By now the companies trading business has become a minor side show relative to its banking activities. As major shareholder, the government has been asked to pave the way for the company to expand even further into the banking business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NHM_collapse_title;Collapse of the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NHM_collapse_desc;The Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij has become as long way from a rather simple majority government owned trading company to the banking juggernaut it has become today. Run from their office in Amsterdam, the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij runs a financial empire unrivalled in the world. Unfortunately this has brought a sense of immortality and arrogance with it. Due to this the company has become over-invested in some markets and projects, which left it without a sufficient cash flow to cover its debt. While under normal circumstance this would be covered by the equity, the recent stock market crash has wiped away all equity of the company. Unable to cover its debts the company is now at the verge of bankruptcy and is threatening to take the whole country with it. An emergency session of cabinet has been convened, and the country eagerly awaits its decision regarding this matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_sell_NHM_desc;The Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij was founded on the orders of king William I to 'stimulate trade, shipping, shipyards, fishing, construction and agriculture.' However it quickly grew as a major trading company, and, from the profits of the trade, into a major banking house. Through the king the state still holds a substantial share of the company. With the recent expansion of the company into the banking business, the value of the our share has sky rocketed. If we are in desperate need of cash, we can sell our share of the company. However, it will result in less influence in the future of the company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_maatschappij_welstand_title;The Maatschappij tot Welstand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_maatschappij_welstand_desc;Our country has always been split between a Protestant north and Catholic south. However with Catholics and Protestants living next to each other in a large part of the country, there are no line where the Protestant 'territory' 'ends' and the Catholic 'begins.' In these 'border regions' there is significant pressure of one group onto the other to convert or move away.\nTo make sure the number of Protestants remain stable in the more Catholic areas of the country, a new 'Society for the Enhancement of Prosperity' has been founded. This charitable society seeks to acquire real estate in Catholic regions, and intends to rent them out to Protestant farmers at subsides rates. The hope is to provide a decent living for Protestant farmers in these regions, preventing them from moving away and possibly attrack new protestant farmers, and thus prevent Catholic influence from creeping up northwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

However little is available, and even less is available for industrial development. An investment bank might offer a way to provide the capital needed for industrial development. It has been proposed to transfer some of the royal estates to the new bank, which, if sold or leveraged, will give the economy a much needed infusion of capital.

As a vertically integrated company, Cockerill also owns interests in the local iron and coal mines. Originally, such industry only existed in Britain, and any export of the technology strictly forbidden. It was John's father, William Cockerill, a successful machine builder in his own right, who memories relevant blueprints before setting of for the mainland. He used his knowledge and expertise to found a machine factory near Liege, which would later be handed over to his sons. His sons have now turned it into the company it is now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He follows the ideals of his great uncle Fredrick the Great regarding the creation of a unitary state, and will not tolerate foreign influence inside his realm.

DIM_NET_concordaat_1827_title;The Concordat of 1827;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_concordaat_1827_desc;The Pope has long been unhappy with our relation with the Church. Currently, these relations are dictated by a concordat signed by Napoleon in 1801. While that concordat has restored some of the rights of the pope (he can now dismiss bishops at will), his powers still remain limited: we reserved the exclusive right to nominate bishops. The greatest limit to his power, however, is the total ban on bishops in the northern Netherlands.\n In an unusual compromise, the Pope is willing to maintain our exclusive right to nominate bishops, if we restore the episcopal hierarchy to the northern Netherlands. Accepting the offer would go a long way to smoothing out matters with our Catholic subjects, but would also greatly offend our protestant subjects. They are fearful the Catholics will come to dominate the nations, and are already up in arms about the matter. Claiming the martyrs of the Eighty Year War will 'rise from the grave in anger.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In effect this means we will now be able to appoint bishops to the cities of Roermond and Den Bosch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_BEL_revolution_stelselwet_title;The Stelselwet\n(Tax Reform of 1821);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_BEL_revolution_stelselwet_desc;The Reformation and the Eighty Years War has caused the two regions of the kingdom to go their separate ways. Economically and culturally. The north flourished while the south languished. The Napoleonic War brought about a reversal of fortunes though, as the Royal Navy blockade and Continental System wiped out northern trade southern industries flourished. These industries are rapidly expanding and the region is flourishing. The north and trade on the other hand is yet to recover from the devastation, and it now languishes. However, while impoverished, the north is rich in capital used to finance governmental spending.\n\nKeeping this in mind, the issue at hands is the tax system. It dates to the Napoleonic Era, is cumbersome and inefficient. Various plans to reform it have been proposed, but none can satisfy the needs of both the north and the south. Which will be favoured under the new tax regime?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_BEL_fonds_voor_nijverheid_title;The Fonds voor Nijverheid;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_BEL_fonds_voor_nijverheid_desc;The focus of the Stelselwet on stimulating northern trade has left a sour taste in the mouth of the southern MPs. In their eyes it is yet another indication that the north dominates the south, and no consideration is given to their needs. Both as a symbolic measure, as well as an actual attempt to satisfy southern needs, the Stelselwet included a provision for a 'Fund to Stimulate Industry' funded by the general fund.\n\nWhile official it is intended to support the south, significant leeway is given to direct the investment.

To counter some of the grievances of the north, parliament quickly voted into law a governmental 'Fund to Stimulate Commerce,' aimed a stimulating northern trade.\n\nWhile official the fund is intended to support the north, the wording is imprecise and cumbersome, and much is left open to interpretation. Will the fund focus on the north, or will it instead be used for other purposes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_BEL_revolution_collegium_philosophicum_title;The Collegium Philosophicum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_BEL_revolution_collegium_philosophicum_desc;Before the unification of the Netherlands, the Catholic Church had a position of privilege and priority in the Southern Netherlands. Whereas in the Northern Netherlands the Calvinistic faith held a similar position. Under our constitution however, all faiths are held equal and all can profess their faith in freedom. In practice, the matter is slightly more complicated as neither faith trusts the other. The Catholics in particularly seem unwilling to relinquish their postion. At least not without consent of the Pope. And herein lies the key: controlling the clergy mean controlling the Catholics. Currently all clergymen are educated at private seminars, and beyond our grasp. To strengthen out grip a plan has been proposed to close down all seminars and found a national one: the Collegium Philosophicum. Staffed by royalists and intended to create a new class of royalists clergy, it will help to wane the populace away from Rome and towards our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_BEL_revolution_collegium_philosophicum_failed_desc;In an effort to form a new cradle of royalist Catholic clergymen the the Collegium Philosophicum was founded, in the hopes that the clergy would educate the populace in a royalist manner. An ambitious undertaking the Collegium has a capacity of 1200 students per year, however so far only 162 students have attended the Collegium. Most parents prefer to sent their children abroad for an ecclesiastical education. A bill banning foreign educated clergymen from being ordained passed parliament to combat this, yet backfired as the clergy has now stopped ordaining those educated at the Collegium.\n\nA stalemate has thus developed, and we have to decided what to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_BEL_revolution_press_issue_title;The Issue of Press Rights;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_BEL_revolution_press_issue_desc;Over the past few months, debates have been raging in southern intellectual circles about the nature of our printing press laws. Under the current laws, the writer is held accountable for any piece of work 'attacking public order.' In case the writer cannot be traced, the publisher is held accountable. However, there is no clear rule as it whether the publisher is accountable per se. In most judicial cases the publisher is held jointly accountable in any case. Some argue that the publisher is 'nothing but a blunt tool', and a tool cannot be held accountable for crimes of conscious. There are also those who argue that the publisher, as legal owner of the work hold full accountability for what they publish. Then there are those who argue that freedom of the press is only possible, if the publisher is not held accountable for the work he prints.\n With he argument set out, it is time to make a decision regarding the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_BEL_revolution_courrier_des_pays_bas_title;Courrier des Pays-Bas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_BEL_revolution_courrier_des_pays_bas_desc;While previously an ally of the government due to our anti-clerical policies, the liberal newspaper the Courrier des Pays-Bas seems to have a had a change of heart recently. It has openly started attacking our governmental policies, and in not too kind of words. As one of the few newspapers not afraid to openly criticise the government, it has a unique draw on the young, the radical and the liberal. Main of their writers have seen the inside of our jails, but this has not diminished their militancy. In fact, it has only encouraged it. And it infamous reputation, combined with its inflammatory commentaries, has made it one of the most popular newspapers in the country with a circulation of 4000.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_BEL_revolution_de_potter_trial_title;The Trial of Louis de Potter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_BEL_revolution_de_potter_trial_desc;An sharp-tongued letter was recently published in a southern newspaper addressed to the king. In it the author, a certain Louis de Potter, quickly summarises the grievances of the people and the defects of our rule. This letter was quickly followed by another one restating the matter.\nThe local prosecutor did not take kindly to these letters, and had the author arrested and brought to trial. This trial is now quickly turning into a disaster for our government. The publicity awarded to de Potter has allowed to restate his points again to a larger audience. When the verdict was finally pronounced the audience responded with angry cheers. When learning of the verdict, the crowd outside started rioting and cheering 'Vive de Potter' and 'down with van Maanen.' The minister's appartments, which happened to be across from the courtroom, did not survive these riots unscathed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_BEL_revolution_lettre_demophile_au_roi_desc;A letter from 'a friend of the people' addressed to the king has been published in the southern regions. Authored by Louis de Potter, the letter calls upon the king to restore the civil liberties enshrined in the constitution. If not, de Potter wars, 'the separation of North and South will be inevitable.' This follows shortly on a similar letter addressed to Pierre van Gobbelschroy, a prominent southern supporter of the king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_BEL_revolution_the_language_laws_title;The Language Laws;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_BEL_revolution_the_language_laws_desc;To form a strong unified kingdom, and protect it against undue French influence, it was decided soon after the Napoleonic Wars to make Dutch the national language and only allow French there where it is necessary. The original transitional period is now coming to an end, and with it the resistance against the law increases. For even among the Flemish populace Dutch is the language for 'the kitchen table and milk stool', not of government and commerce.\nThe question is, do we push on?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_BEL_revolution_a_legalistic_protest_title;A Legalistic Protest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_BEL_revolution_a_legalistic_protest_desc;For many high ranking officials it has proven hard to adjust to our language policies, and many would prefer to continue working in French. The minister under whose purview falls the language laws, minister Van Maanen, has denied a petition of a group of Flemish lawyer who had request to be allowed to continue practising in French. As, according to him, 'French can only be considered a forced upon [the Flemish] side language.' Perhaps not an unreasonable position, as the lawyers would practise in French even if their clients did not speak the language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

[...] In those provinces most needing instruction and direction the French language and culture ought to be stimulated.' -Charles Blargnies\n\nOpposition against the language laws is particularly strong in Brussls. Long has it been the centre of administration and law in the south, and as such as the centre of the southern nobility and bourgeoisie. The groups most likely to be Francophone. After a plea directed at the king personally, minister van Maanen has granted a special exemption to 13 Brussels lawyers to continue practising in French, in direct opposition to our language policies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Whenever the protagonist in the production of 'la Muette de Portici' called for liberty, the crowd answered! Throughout the performance the room echoed with cries such as 'Vive Napoleon!' 'Vive le Duc d'Orleans' and 'Vive la France!' When the singers entered the above quoted couplet, the hall exploded in cries of 'Viva la Liberte!'

DIM_BEL_disintegration_of_the_army_desc;Our conscription policy has been undiscriminating regarding the northern and southern parts of the country. As a matter of fact, southern soldiers are overrepresented in our army. This has now come back to bite us. The southern soldiers have proven to be susceptible to the revolutionary ideas emanating from their home regions. Desertion and insubordination is rife, and, in some instances, the soldiers are in open revolt against their (northern) commanding officers. Worse still, a number of units in the south have opted to actively join the revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_BEL_antwerp_revolution_desc;The city of Antwerp had always been a relative stronghold for unionists in the southern part of the country. The reunification had reopen the Scheldt estuary to shipping to and from Antwerp, and brought great wealth to the city. Still the city has not proven to be resistant to the revolutionary ideas sweeping the south, and has come under revolutionary control!owever, a combination of a relative lack of southern soldiers in the garrison with a strict disciplinarian commander, has resulted in the awkward situation that the citadel controlling the city and harbour is still under our control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

An awkward situation which has caused the necessary friction: the citadel has been subject to daily fire from the city. In an effort to subdue the city and silence the guns once and for all, the commander of the citadel, general Chasse, ordered the guns to be turned around and the city to be bombarded. It would take almost 8 hours before the guns would fall silent again. The city is devastated, and hundreds have been killed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_van_speijk_desc;When one of our patrol boats on the Scheldt river was boarded by Belgian revolutionaries demanding its surrender, her commander (29 year old Jan van Speijk) decided to become a national hero. Rather than surrender his ship, he fired a pistol (some say he threw a lighted cigar) into a barrel of gunpowder in the ship's magazine.

They are now requesting permission to cross the border, so they can start fighting there. These battalions are fully privately funded and organised, and their operations in Belgium will not cost us anything. Their operation in the revolution might reflect poorly on us. On the other hand, they might also pave the way for closer relations with the Belgian peoples in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_legion_belge_parisienne_BEL_desc;Inspired by our plight for freedom from the Dutch, French citizens have joined our ranks and are ready to fight the Dutch!

DIM_NET_administrative_split_title;The Administrative Division of the Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_NET_administrative_split_desc;The political situation in the kingdom is starting to become difficult. The southern populace oppose our most of our policies, whether they be economic, religious or political. However giving in to the southern demands would severely upset the northern populace. Perhaps the economic, social and cultural differences between north and south are so great that the kingdom cannot function as an unitary state. A plan has been presented to split the kingdom into two separate administrative units, each with its own parliament and government united under our dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The church fathers are afraid that any further ringing of the bells would only serve to demoralise the already hard hit populace.\n\nThe northern regions of the country, the city of Groningen in particular, have been stuck by an 'intermittent fevers' causing a jump in the number of deaths. Another hard hit city is the city of Sneek, in the province of Friesland, which has reported a threefold increase of deaths over previous years. Recent flooding of the countryside in the region, combined with the unusual warm weather, is suspected in causing this epidemic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_flood_1825_desc;Water is an ever present danger, and an ever continuing fight to keep our, for our country. One third of the country lies below the level of the sea, and half of the country is vulnerable to flooding. Only a system of natural dunes and man made dikes stands between the people and disaster.\n\nA strong north western storm battered the coast last night. Swelled up up by the wind, the water reached levels up to 3.5 higher than normal. The dikes around the Zuiderzee, already weakened by storms earlier this year, were not up to the task. Water is now quickly flooding into the country side. Almost half of the provinces of Friesland and Overijssel, and the polder north of Amsterdam is flooded.\n\nCleaning up the flood damage is sure to be expensive and time consuming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_flood_1855_title;The Flooding of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_flood_1855_desc;The dikes along the Rhine river have given way to the water! The severe winter hitting the country has caused an ice dam to form on the river, trapping the water behind it. When the dam finally gave way to the mass of water, it took a substantial part of the dike flanking the river with it. The water has now flooded into the valley along the river, destroying many homes and farms in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DIM_flood_1861_1_desc;The dikes along the Waal river have given way to the water! Heavy ice had gathered on the river, and an ice dam was spotted forming in a narrowing of the river near the village of Vuren. Despite the best efforts of the local resides, it had proven impossible to remove the ice dam. With the ice dam not budging, it was only a matter of time before the dikes would be breached. Luckily, no-one was killed, but the material damage is substantial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_flood_1861_2_title;The Flooding of the land of Maas and Waal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIM_flood_1861_2_desc;Due to ice blocking the flow of the river, the Waal river breached the dikes protecting the 'Land of Maas and Waal.' Such is the flow of water into the region, that it has started spilling over the dikes into the Meuse river on the other side.

Especially the region around Antwerp has been hit hard. Vast swaths of land have been flooded, and, due to the tidal nature of the Scheldt, reparations have proven difficult. As with each new tide new water flows through the breaches in the dikes. Until the dikes are repaired it will be impossible to pump all the water out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

A number of factors can be blamed, drought, strong winds, improper fireproofing, but our own contribution to the fire should not be overlooked: in celebration of the king's visit the city was beautifully decorated with flowers, banners and triumphal arches.

It would seem the madness of the king has reached socialist circles: a pamphlet called 'A Day in the Life of King Gorilla' was recently released and has become quite popular. The pamphlet describes 'the criminal life' and the 'corrupted nature' of the royal house, calling the king an unconsidered 'sadistic monster' who cares not about his people.\nThis, combined with another recent pamphlet describing the king as 'a regal pig' and 'horny mandrill,' triggered some passionate feelings.
